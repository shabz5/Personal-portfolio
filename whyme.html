                      Undertaking a Bsc Geography course helped me to refine my numerical data analysis, presentation and research skills. I have been abe to refine my skillset through research trip both domestically and abroard. these trips allowed me to understand how to use both soft skills such as team work and leadership skills as well as hard skills such as  data collection and analysis together to produce a high level of work. I also had to quickly  adapt to different situations and environments and learn how to communicate with people who may not have English as a first langauge or have a basic understanding of the issues I was trying to research. Being able to produce qualititve based projects as well as quanititive projects allowed me to explore  more creative soltuions and ideas for everyday, real word issues.  <strong>These expreinces thus allow me to tackle problems with a holistic view, using a blend of logical and creative ideas to come up with the most effective solution.</strong>

                       I have exprience working within a Fintech start-up as well as a comedy club where I used my skill set to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, within the busniess, sales, admin and marketing sectors. My degree also taught me about subjects and issues happening at the time, thus my adacemic background is far more than just theortical, I have a deep understanding of real world issues going on currently and a keen intrest in these issues, tailoring my degree to focus on  development, economic (ESG focused), risk analysis and social issues. one of my economic geography modules had me create a executive summary, financial report and present a pitch to find a solution to a social issue within a country chosen for us this further emphasizes the  practicle expreince that I have gained.

                      My degree has refined my ability to recognise  moral and ethical issues involved when problem solving. I take a holistic view when coming up with solutions, using  iterative approaches to garantee a variety of viewpoints are understood and taken into consideration when coming up with a solution.
